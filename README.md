# 3ml-core
## LunarLatte Markup Language
> A simple Markup parser suited for reading and storing data into a Tag structure.

Originally, **3ml** is designed for storing maps and configuration files in a small game called [Kogaplanet](https://github.com/Finalshare90/kogaplanet-launcher), but it can be used freely in any software(with the right APIs).
